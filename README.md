# TAL Teasers - Style Aware Audio Content Summarization

This project explores the task of abstractive summarization of long-form narrative audio content with a focus on This American Life.

Originally developed as a Jupyter Notebook for an NLP course, the code is being transferred to a modular local environment using Python scripts, 
virtual environments, and Git version control. All development is done in Emacs, with Magit for Git/GitHub integration.
